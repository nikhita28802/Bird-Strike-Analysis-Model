# Bird-Strike-Analysis-Model
🌍 Tackling Aviation Safety with Data Analytics ✈️
Submission as Data Science intern at https://lnkd.in/gykGAAT8


I’m excited to share insights from my recent internship project at UnifiedMentor, where I dove into a critical issue in the aviation industry – Bird Strikes. These collisions between aircraft and birds pose a serious threat to safety, and understanding the data behind these incidents is crucial to improving preventative measures.
🔍 Project Overview: The project involved analyzing bird strikes reported by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) between 2000 and 2011. Using the power of data visualization and analytics, I developed a Power BI dashboard to highlight key metrics and trends, helping aviation experts gain a better understanding of these occurrences.
💡 Key Metrics Explored:
Yearly Number of Bird Strikes: Identifying trends in the frequency of bird strikes.
Top Airlines & Airports: Revealing which airlines and airports experienced the most bird strikes.
Yearly Costs Incurred: Financial analysis of the cost of damage due to bird strikes.
Flight Phases: Examining which phases of flight are most vulnerable (e.g., take-off, landing).
Altitude Analysis: Exploring the altitudes at which bird strikes are most common.
Pilot Warnings: Investigating whether pilots were warned or informed prior to strikes.
🎯 Power BI Dashboard Design:
Multi-Page Dashboard: Split across different sections to visualize:
Yearly trends.
Airline and airport data.
Financial impacts.
Flight phase and altitude comparisons.
Interactive Navigation: With backward and forward buttons to navigate between pages, ensuring smooth and user-friendly interaction.
Drill-Down Capabilities: Users can explore specific data points, such as seeing the top 50 airports with the highest bird strike incidents or analyzing the average altitude during these incidents.
🛠️ Tools Used:
Power BI: For creating dynamic visuals and reports.
Python: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
This internship has provided me with an incredible opportunity to apply my data analytics skills to a real-world problem and to contribute to solutions for improving aviation safety.
🚀 Looking forward to the next challenge!
